          <h2>Our Story</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in 2023, MovieHub began as a small project by a group of film enthusiasts 
            who wanted to create a better way to discover and discuss movies. What started as 
            a passion project has grown into a platform used by movie lovers worldwide.
          </p>
          <p>
            We believe that great films have the power to inspire, educate, and transform. 
            Our goal is to help you find those films that will leave a lasting impression.
